#### Introduction
- History of R, nature and interaction of R with other software
- Usefulness/benefits and cons of using R
	- Free: GNU General Public License
	- Run of different platforms: Windows, Unix and MacOS as well on server
	- Applied in very diverse fields over 15k official packages on RCran
	- Advanced graphic capabilities
	- Object-oriented programming: flexible and extensible
	- R is a case sensitive language
	- Memory-greedy
- Applications of R
---

#### Getting started 
- Requirements: computer/server specifications
- R platform: R. 
	- Download and install the recent stable version from [R from CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/)
- IDE: RStudio IDE, Rstudio, Rstudio Server, Jupyter notebook, Other platforms(kaggle, AWS)
	- Download the appropriate version of [R Studio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/) -
- R packages: core and third-party - Repos: GitHub, RCran, r-forge, etc and how to install packages from respective repos
- Installation and understanding the RStudio/Jupyter notebook platform including logging
	- Terminal: command entered and display results.  Useful for calculating and displaying small short-term expressions such as `2+2`. R prompt (`>`) indicates position to enter commands and an indication that previous command, if applicable, has completed; Terminal - to type and run shell commands.
	- Explorer: constitutes File browser - to display and manipulate the current working directory `getwd()`; Plots/viewer - display graphics during analysis; packages - installing, loading and unloading packages; help - documentation on installed packages
	- Environment: consists of environment - hold details of all objects such as data, models, vectors, functions; history - log of the historical use of the R software since installation; connections - to databases and servers
	- Editor: scripts/codes to . useful for reproduceable codes
- Getting help: R/package, stack overflow

#### Data management and basic statistics
- Operators: assigment; comments
- Accessing objects on the Rstudio
- Understanding of variable types(integer, numeric, character, etc); data types(vectors, matrices, data frames/data.table)
- Creating or reading different types of data
- Writing/saving data
- Understanding the data: variable types, overview, size, data type, missing points
- Data conversions and transformations, conditional transformations of specific variables
- Other data manipulations: subsetting, slicing, reshaping, merging
- Data summaries, basic statistics(fivenum)
---

#### General analysis and functions
- Group summaries and transformations
- Inferential statistics: t.test, non-parametric statistics
- Plotting: scatter, time series, density and smoothing, histograms, barplots, group/trellis plots,
- Adding labels, colors, changing types, superimposing other plots(lines)
- Iterations: for(), while() loops
- Functions: use of 'apply' sets of functions
- Basic custom functions
---

#### Specific analysis and visualizations
- ANOVA and Linear Models
- GLM and GLS models: logistic, 
- Visualization with ggplot
---

#### Time series analysis
---

#### Advanced analysis
- Multivariate analysis: PCA
- Machine learning: k-NN, RF, SVM, ANN, and performance indicators
